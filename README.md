Robot model description package for the Wuji Hand and related accessories. Provides URDF, MuJoCo (MJCF), and USD assets for simulation and visualization, plus STEP/CAD files for mechanical integration. Includes a ROS2 launch and RViz configuration for quick inspection of left and right hand models.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wuji-technology/wuji-description.git
cd wuji-description
```

### Hand Body

#### MuJoCo

```bash
# Right hand
python -m mujoco.viewer --mjcf=hand/body/mjcf/right.xml

# Left hand
python -m mujoco.viewer --mjcf=hand/body/mjcf/left.xml
```

#### ROS2 and RViz

`hand/body/` is the ROS2 package source (`wuji_description`). The package installs `hand/attachment/` as a sibling resource, so clone the entire repository into your workspace `src/` rather than copying `hand/body/` in isolation:

```bash
# Source ROS2 environment, replace <distro> with your installed ROS2 distribution
source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash

cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/wuji-technology/wuji-description.git
cd ..

rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-select wuji_description
source install/setup.bash

# Left hand (default)
ros2 launch wuji_description display.launch.py

# Right hand
ros2 launch wuji_description display.launch.py hand:=right
```

#### Isaac Sim (USD)

Load `hand/body/usd/left/wujihand.usd` or `hand/body/usd/right/wujihand.usd` directly in Isaac Sim.
For a complete simulation example, see [isaaclab-sim](https://github.com/wuji-technology/isaaclab-sim).

### Hand Attachments

`hand/attachment/` ships optional components for the Wuji Hand. They are not loaded by the default display launch file; attach them via a fixed joint when composing a full robot description.

- **`impact-resistant-attachment/`** — a docking link designed to absorb impacts before they reach the hand. Includes STL mesh, URDF (relative and `package://` variants), MJCF, and USD for full simulation integration.
- **`step/`** — STEP source files for two adapters that connect the hand to a robotic arm flange:
  - `Direct-Adapter-Mount.step` — rigid direct mount.
  - `Impact-Resistant-Adapter.step` — mechanical companion to the impact-resistant attachment above.
  - Each option ships with an assembled PDF drawing. See [Adapter-Installation-Instructions.md](hand/attachment/step/Adapter-Installation-Instructions.md) for step-by-step mounting guidance.
- **`unitree-g1-attachment/`** — STL adapter for mounting the Wuji Hand on a Unitree G1 humanoid.

Preview the impact-resistant attachment in MuJoCo:

```bash
python -m mujoco.viewer --mjcf=hand/attachment/impact-resistant-attachment/mjcf/docking.xml
```

URDF preview with a non-ROS viewer such as `urdf-viz`:

```bash
urdf-viz hand/attachment/impact-resistant-attachment/urdf/docking.urdf
```

### Glove

`glove/attachment/glove-attachment.step` provides a STEP file for the Wuji Glove mounting interface. Additional glove assets are planned for future releases.
